Pun intended.

A space physics game (forever stuck) in early development. Launch and land a spacecraft, collect and transport bits of ore with your tractor beam and complete each mini-misson's goal while fighting/using the gravity of the surrounding objects and painfully scarce resources (time, fuel, money, ...).

**The game mechanics are mostly complete, but it's still missing a proper mission campaign.**

This was developed in an (by now) ancient version of jMonkeyEngine. The project may serve as an inspiration or reference for games using similar concepts, but it won't be developed any further.
