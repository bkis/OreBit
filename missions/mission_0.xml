MISSION TEMPLATE XML
********************
This template contains every possible element that can be used in mission design.
Please read the comments to understand how they work!
(A comment in XML looks like the text block you are reading right now!)
You can copy and modify this file to make the mission design process as easy as possible.
Optional elements are marked as such in the comments.
If you leave them out (remove tag completely from file!) - the given default values will be used!
Use any advanced text editor that can highlight XML syntax (like "notepad++"" or "Sublime Text")
as working with a simple monochromatic text editor will
be very difficult! Also turn off automatic line wrapping!

!!! CAUTION: DON'T MAKE OBJECTS OVERLAP! IT WILL CRASH THE GAME !!!

    <!--        MISSION DATA
    *********************************** -->
    <title>Getting Comfortable</title> <!-- will be shown on shop/mission screen -->
    <description>Dear space cadet,&#10;welcome to the campaign! This first mission requires nothing but sitting in the cockpit and getting comfortable with the seat. Just don't touch anything, yet! If you manage not to destroy the ship for 10 seconds, the mission is complete and you'll get some money for your further campaign budget.&#10;Every time you start a new mission, it costs us 500 generic money units to build a new ship for it. Of course we take that money from your budget.&#10;So if you run out of money, the campaign is over! Don't just throw your cash into the upgrade shop! ...although it has some tempting offers...</description> <!-- will be shown on shop/mission screen -->
