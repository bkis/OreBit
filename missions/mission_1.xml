MISSION TEMPLATE XML
********************
This template contains every possible element that can be used in mission design.
Please read the comments to understand how they work!
(A comment in XML looks like the text block you are reading right now!)
You can copy and modify this file to make the mission design process as easy as possible.
Optional elements are marked as such in the comments.
If you leave them out (remove tag completely from file!) - the given default values will be used!
Use any advanced text editor that can highlight XML syntax (like "notepad++"" or "Sublime Text")
as working with a simple monochromatic text editor will
be very difficult! Also turn off automatic line wrapping!

!!! CAUTION: DON'T MAKE OBJECTS OVERLAP! IT WILL CRASH THE GAME !!!
